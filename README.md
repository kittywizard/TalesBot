## /prompt
Use this to generate a random prompt from the over 3,500 prompts available. They can be anything from emotions to famous sayings.

number: can specify any number of prompts.


## /help

Brings up the help message in a DM.


## /topping


Use to generate toppings - fun little challenges that you can add to your prompts. (Things like, write from a villain's perspective, minor characters or a character as a child).


**Optional:**


list: enter true to see a list of all possible toppings. (false will do nothing - this will be fixed in future update)
